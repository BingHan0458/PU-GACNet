## please be patient whn complie tf_ops. This is the hardest part in reproducing our results.

# Using different system may require different code for compiling. But is is not always correct.
# Try both to compile.
# If both of them does not work, make sure tf_lib, tf_inc, cuda_lib all correct and $nvcc is the same version as CUDA


# eg. Below is the env I used for the remote cluster
module load cuda/10.0.130
# If below does not work, you can try to set system='linux'
#system="centos" #
system="linux" # or centos, difference is we comment -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 out in centos
# below xxx is your account name. you may have to change the path to your own.
